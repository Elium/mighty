# Welcome to Mighty JS (MJS)

## Preamble

MJS is browser side ORM / in memory data-store, written in pure JS.
It has been inspired by EmberData, Backbone models, js-data and Waterline.

## Why ?

When working on huge, enterprise size client side projects, you have to structure your application with good separation of concerns.
A good way to do it is to use the MVC pattern, or one of its variants.

The Model part is often misunderstood : developpers usually uses plain javascript objects without any mapping, validations, etc.

That's where MJS is going strong, look at all the features bellow.
